### about

these are my dotfiles. version control is done with git. make is used to
symlink everything and compile my builds of suckless programs. i strive to use
tools which align well with the unix philosophy.

# install

```
make
```

### extras

skeleton files for programs that have secrets(git) are in 'secrets'.
