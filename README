these are my dotfiles. version control is done with git. make is used to
symlink everything and compile my builds of suckless programs. i strive to use
tools which align well with the unix philosophy.

window decorations should be turned off for gui apps that have the option. this
can be done in most apps by enabling the "use system titlebars" option.

skeleton files for programs that have secrets(git) are in `secrets`.
