✨ about ✨
-----------

these are my dotfiles. version control is done with git. make is used to symlin
k everything and compile my builds of suckless programs. i strive to use tools
which align well with the unix philosophy.


💿 install
----------

    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~unrealapex/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    make


🗒️ extras
---------

window decorations should be turned off for gui apps that have the option. this
can be done in most apps by enabling the "use system titlebars" option.

skeleton files for programs that have secrets(git) are in `secrets`.
